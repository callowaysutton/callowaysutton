<h1 align="center"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [A small toolbox webapp](https://github.com/callowaysutton/WebToolBox) for middle schoolers trying to dive into coding, a Vulkan 2D game engine and the Shaft Programming Language; Last two are very much Work in Progress
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Svelte framework and the Vulkan API
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the small toolbox webapp
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the Vulkan API
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about mountain biking, hiking, running, super trampolining, or soccer
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Instagram](instagram.com/callowaysutton) and [Email](mailto:contact@ceo.sex) would probably be best
- âš¡ Fun fact: my first laptop, in 2008, was an x86 compatible single core 433Mhz beast which is now approximately 2.5-3x slower than my current router with its Quad-core ARMv11 1.7Ghz chip.
